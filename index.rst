Jetstream2
==================

This is the placeholder for future **Jetstream2** documentation.

Jetstream 2, a transformative update to the NSF’s science and engineering cloud infrastructure, will provide 8 petaFLOPS of virtual supercomputing power to simplify data analysis, boost discovery, and increase availability of AI resources.

Consisting of five computational systems, Jetstream 2’s primary system will be located at Indiana University, with four smaller regional systems deployed nationwide at partners Arizona State University, Cornell University, the University of Hawai’i, and the Texas Advanced Computing Center. The 8 petaFLOPS cloud computing system will use next-generation AMD EPYC processors and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and 18.5 petabytes of storage. Within the Pervasive Technology Institute the project will be led by UITS Research Technologies with key contributions from the Cyberinfrastructure Integration Research Center and the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research. Additional Jetstream 2 partners include the University of Arizona, Johns Hopkins University, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, with Dell Inc. as the primary supplier.

The Jetstream 2 project is funded under `NSF award number 2005506 <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2005506>`_.
