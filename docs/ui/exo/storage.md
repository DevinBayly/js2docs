# Using Storage Under Exosphere

## Volumes

In Exosphere, you can create volumes and attach them to instances. Exosphere will display the volume mount point in the user interfaces.

Please note that attached volumes are mounted the first time they are accessed inside the instance (e.g. with a `cd` command).

## File Shares

Support for shared filesystems (using OpenStack Manila) is coming soon.
