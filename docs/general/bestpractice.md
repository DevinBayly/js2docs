# Best Practices for Jetstream2

Many of the best practices for using Jetstream2 are laid out in the [Security FAQ](../faq/security.md). These include such things as:

* Updating your virtual machines
* Running host-based firewalls
* Securing services

As more best practices are defined, we will add them here.

Additionally, using the latest version of Ubuntu or RPM-based (e.g. CentOS, Rocky, Alma) Linux distribution is highly encouraged. While we do always maintain one revision back from the current release, we highly encourage people to use the most recent operating system that will meet their needs.

As such, we will also provide new Ubuntu and Rocky releases as they become available, are tested thoroughly, and are found to work with the Jetstream2 cloud. We will retire the oldest version as we bring the newest version into service.
