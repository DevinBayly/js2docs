#Software Licenses

Software licenses are generally **the responsibility of the user** to obtain, coordinate, implement, and maintain.

Some licenses may require users to coordinate with Jetstream staff to allow for proper configuration. Such coordination is handled on a case-by-base basis.

Licensed software maintained by staff but available to users are listed below. 

#### Compilers and Parallel Libraries

*   The **Intel Compiler** is covered on the primary cloud by a site license and has been configured to point to the proper license server.
*   All components of the Intel Parallel Studio are covered by the IU site license, including the MKL libraries. 

#### Specialty software
 
*   **MATLAB** is covered on the primary cloud by a site license and has been configured to point to the proper license server.
  

If you need licenses for any other software that is not provided through the Jetstream2 shared software store then you will have to provide your own license. Licenses on regional clouds may vary and will need to be discussed with the regional cloud provider. 

> Please be aware that if you take an image or software from Jetstream and 
 run it somewhere else then the license will **not** work. Jetstream license 
 servers restrict access to only valid Jetstream IP addresses.

*It is also the responsibility of the PI and those placed on each allocation to ensure that they are complying with the terms of any software license they are using on Jetstream2.*
