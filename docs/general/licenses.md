#Software Licenses

Software licenses are generally **the responsibility of the user** to obtain, coordinate, implement, and maintain.

Some licenses may require users to coordinate with Jetstream staff to allow for proper configuration. Such coordination is handled on a case-by-base basis.

Licensed software maintained by staff but available to users are listed below. 

#### Compilers and Parallel Libraries

*   The Intel compiler is covered on the primary cloud by a site license and has been configured to point to the proper license server.
*   All components of the Intel Parallel Studio are covered by the IU site license, including the MKL libraries. 

#### Specialty software

*   ****MATLAB:**** licenses are available on the primary cloud
    *   MATLAB, like other Jetstream2 software, is available via the shared software store on the primary cloud
  

If you need licenses for any other software that is not provided through the Jetstream2 shared software store then you will have to provide your own license.

Please be aware that if you take an image or software from Jetstream and run it somewhere else then the license will **not** work. Jetstream license servers restrict access to only valid Jetstream IP addresses.

It is also the responsibility of the PI and those placed on each allocation to ensure that they are complying with the terms of any software license they are using on Jetstream2.
