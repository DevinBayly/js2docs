# Featured Images

Jetstream2 will have a limited set of featured images. These are images that the Jestream2 team curates and maintains.

A key difference between Jetstream1 and Jetstream2 is that there will not be application specific featured images. We will maintain a [software collection](software.md) that will be made available on every virtual machine at boot. Software will be loaded via [Lmod Modules](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){target=_blank}.

At this time, the featured images will be:

* Ubuntu 20.04
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Rocky 8
* CentOS 7
* Ubuntu 20.04 for NVIDIA (for GPU nodes)
* Rocky 8 for NVIDIA (for GPU nodes)

These featured images will evolve over time. As distributions leave support (e.g Ubuntu 18 will end support in April 2023), we will replace them with newer, supported versions.

Our goal is to maintain a minimum of featured images but keep them updated via automated pipeline on a weekly basis.
