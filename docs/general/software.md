#Jetstream2 Software Collection

Details on the Jetstream2 Software Collection will be forthcoming. At this time, we anticipate a shared disk that will be automatically mounted by instances. Researchers will then be able to use modules to load any combination of software they need, similar to how HPC systems do it.

This list will be ever evolving, but at this time, pre-launch, we anticipate the following software on the shared software store:

* Matlab
* R / R Studio / Shiny
* Intel Compiler
* NVIDIA (formerly PGI) Compiler
* AOCC Compiler
* Anaconda (may live on image itself for simplicity)
* Databases (e.g. Mysql, Postgresql, Mongo)
* Java
* Jupyter/JupyterLab/JupyterHub
* WQ-Maker
* Genemark
* BLAT
* CUDA (may use containers only)
* NVIDIA HPC SDK (may use containers only)

This is still an ongoing effort so this list will almost certainly change in coming weeks and months.
