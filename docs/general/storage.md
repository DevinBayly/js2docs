# Jetstream2 Storage

Jetstream2 storage is an allocated resource. All allocations will be given a default storage amount (as noted on the [Jetstream2 Resources](resources.md) page).

This storage is usable by all users on that allocation so the PI may want to institute per user quotas or discuss proper usage etiquette with the members of their allocation. Jetstream2 staff will not institute per user storage quotas, with the exception of the Jetstream2 Trial Allocation.


**Limits on Jetstream2 Storage**

- Startup allocations are generally limited to 5-10TB max
- Education allocations are generally limited to 10TB max
- Research allocations are genereally limited to 40TB max

All are subject to proper justification in the [allocations](../alloc/overview.md) process. Maxmimum values may be adjusted with proper justification and if there are adequate resources available. This is entirely at the discretion of the Jetstream2 team.
