# Manila - Filesystems-as-a-service - on Jetstream2

Manila is the file share service project for OpenStack. Manila provides the management of file shares for example, NFS and CIFS, as a core service to OpenStack. Manila works with a variety of proprietary backend storage arrays and appliances, with open source distributed filesystems, as well as with a base Linux NFS or Samba server.
With Manila, you can have multiple instances on Jetstream2 share a filesystem.
Prereqs: Make sure you have these packages installed on your instance: ceph-commons and ceph-fuse
