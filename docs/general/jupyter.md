# Jupyter on Jetstream2

The easiest way to use a Jupyter notebook on Jetstream2 is to launch an instance using [Exosphere](../ui/exo/exo.md), making sure to [launch with the web desktop enabled](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/ui/exo/create_instance/#configure-instance).

Then you can open a web desktop session in Exosphere, open a terminal, and type the commands

    module load anaconda
    jupyter notebook

This should load the Anaconda package and then initialize a new jupyter notebook and open the default browser with the notebook.

*Instructions for launch via the command line will be coming*
