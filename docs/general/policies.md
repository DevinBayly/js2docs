#Acceptable Use Policies and Research and Export Control Guidance  

In general, fundamental, publishable research is permitted on Jetstream from any non-EAR sanctioned countries. Fundamental research is defined as:

---
> “Fundamental research means basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from Industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reason.” <i>[National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189, National Policy on the Transfer of Scientific, Technical, and Engineering Information]</i>

For anything other than fundamental, publishable research, you may wish to consult with your institution’s export control office for any export/sharing restrictions.

Jetstream researchers agree to:

*   Ensure that data that must be protected by Federal security or privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA, FERPA, ITAR, classified information, export control, etc.) are not stored on this system unless such storage and usage is specifically authorized by the responsible University administrator and complies with any processes for management of access to such information. For export controlled information, including ITAR information, approval of the University Export Compliance Office is required prior to use of the Jetstream systems for storage/processing of export controlled data. The Jetstream system is not intended, by default, to meet the security requirements of these laws or regulations and specific usage related controls or restrictions may be required prior to authorization of the use of the Jetstream system for such purposes.
    
*   Ensure that the project does not violate any export control end use restrictions contained in [Part 744 of the EAR](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulations-docs/2343-part-744-control-policy-end-user-and-end-use-based-2/file).

### Countries with heightened restrictions

Some countries have some heightened control over certain types of research and technology. Please consult with your institution’s export control office to ensure that you are in full compliance with US regulations and institutional policies when working with countries under heightened controls and/or when working with research or information that may be limited by export control law.

The US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industrial Security (BIS) publishes a list of EAR Country Group designations. Country Group D (countries of national security concern to the United States) face these heightened control restrictions and are included in [this document of country groups.](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/2255-supplement-no-1-to-part-740-country-groups-1/file) (Please note that Country Group D begins on page 6 of this document.)
