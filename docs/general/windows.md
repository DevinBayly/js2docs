# Microsoft Windows on Jetstream2

Microsoft Windows is not officially supported on Jetstream2. We will be making a limited number of images available for experimental use.

While these images will be created by one of the Jetstream2 parters in conjunction with Jetstream2 staff, it is NOT supported nor guaranteed to work. It is unlikely that the Jetstream2 staff will be able to do more than general VM troubleshooting as we do not have Windows expertise on staff. No license will be installed so you will need to bring your own license.

It is not known at this time whether GPUs will work on Microsoft-based instances. We will test this as time permits.
