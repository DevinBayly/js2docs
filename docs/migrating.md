#Migrating from Jetstream1 to Jetstream2

Jetstream1 will remain online through the end of Q1 2022. We will stop accepting and new allocations on Jetstream1 as soon as Jetstream2 enters operations phase. That date is still yet to be determined. The team is actively working on a migration plan for allocations and resources on Jetstream1 but we are not ready to make that publicly available at this time.

Please watch this space and [XSEDE user news](https://www.xsede.org/news/user-news){target=_blank} and mailing lists for announcements about Jetstream2 operations and migration.
