Jetstream2 is a user-friendly cloud computing environment for researchers and educators running on OpenStack and featuring Atmosphere2/CACAO for the primary graphical user interface. It is built on the successes of Jetstream1 and continues the primary features of that system while extending to a broader range of hardware and services, including GPUs, large memory nodes, virtual clustering, programmable cyberinfrastructure with OpenStack Heat and Terraform, and many other features.

It is designed to provide configurable cyberinfrastructure that gives researchers access to interactive computing and data analysis resources on demand, whenever and wherever they want to analyze their data, as well as providing consistent hosting for science gateways and other infrastructure and development projects. For a more in-depth description please see the [System Overview](/overview/overview.md).
