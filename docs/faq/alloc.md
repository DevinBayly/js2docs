#Jetstream Allocations FAQ

 **1. Is there an overview of the types of allocations available as well as any restrictions those allocations have?**

> The [Getting Started guide](https://www.xsede.org/for-users/getting-started){target=_blank} describes the process of getting onto XSEDE, applying for allocations and using XSEDE resources. To review the types of allocations XSEDE and the process to get an allocation, here are some links you might find useful:

  **2.  Is there a example or demonstration of how to get an allocation that I could follow?**

> There is a Cornell Virtual Workshop (CVW) on getting a Research Allocation for Jetstream here: [https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/JetstreamReq/](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/JetstreamReq/){target=_blank} -- UPDATE FOR JS2

   **3. How do I let other XSEDE accounts use my allocation?**

> To add users to, or remove them from, an active Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment ([XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/documents/527334/695761/what-is-XSEDE.pdf){target=_blank}) allocation, the principal investigator, co-principal investigator, or [allocation manager](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/managing#manageusers){target=_blank} can follow the instructions here:

>  * [https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/managing](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/managing){target=_blank}

> _**Please note that it can take up to four hours for users added to an allocation to become active.**_

   **4. How often can I get a startup allocation?**

> Applications for startup allocations will only be accepted once. After the startup runs out it is best to apply for a research allocation.

---

  **5. I'm running out of Service Units (SUs) or storage. How do I request more?**

> If you already have an XSEDE allocation and need to request additional service units (SUs), the PI, co-PI, or delegate may submit a request via the XSEDE User Portal. For instructions on how to submit the request, see [Requesting additional SUs or storage for Jetstream -- Supplemental Allocations](Requesting-additional-SUs-or-storage-for-Jetstream----Supplemental-Allocations_659423233.html)

I am at or exceeding the quota limits for my allocation.

How do I request additional resources such as CPUs and memory?

Additional CPUs and memory may be requested via Atmosphere.  See [How to request additional resources on Jetstream.](https://iujetstream.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JWT/How+to+request+additional+resources+on+Jetstream)
