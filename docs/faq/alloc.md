#Jetstream2 Allocations FAQ

 **1. Is there an overview of the types of allocations available as well as any restrictions those allocations have?**

> The [Getting Started guide](https://www.xsede.org/for-users/getting-started){target=_blank} describes the process of getting onto XSEDE, applying for allocations and using XSEDE resources. To review the types of allocations XSEDE and the process to get an allocation, here are some links you might find useful:

  *   [Types of allocations, eligibility, details](https://www.xsede.org/web/xup/documentation-overview#allocations-types){target=_blank}
  *   [Allocation policies](https://portal.xsede.org/allocation-policies){target=_blank}

  **2.  Is there a example or demonstration of how to get an allocation that I could follow?**

> There is a Cornell Virtual Workshop (CVW) on getting a Research Allocation for Jetstream here: [https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/JetstreamReq/](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/JetstreamReq/){target=_blank} -- UPDATE FOR JS2

   **3. How do I let other XSEDE accounts use my allocation?**

> To add users to, or remove them from, an active Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment ([XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/documents/527334/695761/what-is-XSEDE.pdf){target=_blank}) allocation, the principal investigator, co-principal investigator, or [allocation manager](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/managing#manageusers){target=_blank} can follow the instructions here:

```    Please note that it can take up to four hours for users added to an allocation to become active.
```

   **4. How often can I get a startup allocation?**

> Applications for startup allocations will only be accepted once. If you have modest needs that are equal or less than startup values, you may renew your startup allocation. If you need a larger allocation, it is best to apply for a [research allocation](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/research){target=_blank}.

> Maximum Startup/Campus Champion Allocation values for each resource are:
> * Jetstream2 CPU - 200,000 SUs
> * Jetstream2 Large Memory - 400,000 SUs
> * Jetstream2 GPU - 600,000 SUs
> * Jetstream2 Storage - 1TB default*
>
> * Storage limits may be larger than 1TB per allocation for a startup if well-justified.

  **5. I'm running out of Service Units (SUs) or storage. How do I request more?**

> If you already have an XSEDE allocation and need to request additional service units (SUs), the PI, co-PI, or delegate may submit a request via the XSEDE User Portal. For instructions on how to submit the request, see [Requesting additional SUs, other Jetstream resources, or storage for Jetstream -- Supplemental Allocations](../alloc/supplement.md){target=_blank}.

  **6. I am at or exceeding the quota limits for my allocation.**

> How do I request additional resources such as CPUs and memory?

> TBD
