#Jetstream2 Early Operations FAQ

**Early operations has started on Jetstream2! Official start date is February 9, 2022. We will continue early operations until acceptance is complete by the National Science Foundation. We will post more complete timelines as we will post them here and all official announcements will be made via** [XSEDE user news](https://www.xsede.org/news/user-news){target=_blank}.

  **1. When will Jetstream2 be available for XSEDE research allocations?**

Jetstream2 is presently available only via the XSEDE Resource Allocation System for research allocation submissions. The system is still not available to researchers, educators, or students at this time. All research allocations successfully receiving a Jetstream2 research award will be amongst the first groups given access to Jetstream2.

Please see this page for more information: [XSEDE Research Allocations](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/research){target=_blank}

  **2. When will Jetstream2 be available for XSEDE startup and education allocations?**

Until Jetstream2 completes National Science Foundation (NSF) acceptance testing, timelines remain uncertain. Once acceptance testing has been completed, documented, presented and approved by the NSF, we will be able to publish a more definitive timeline.

Please watch this space and [XSEDE user news](https://www.xsede.org/news/user-news){target=_blank} and mailing lists for announcements about Jetstream2 operations, access, and migration.

All Jetstream users should be added when they are placed on an allocation, but you may wish to verify so that you don't miss any important operations updates.

  **3. When will Jetstream2 be available for Jetstream2 Trial allocations?**

Jetstream2 Trial Allocations will be made available after Jetstream2 goes into production. They will likely not be available in early user operations.

Until Jetstream2 completes National Science Foundation (NSF) acceptance testing, timelines remain uncertain. Once acceptance testing has been completed, documented, presented and approved by the NSF, we will be able to publish a more definitive timeline.

  **4. My research group wants to bring up a new gateway or infrastructure project, should I wait for Jetstream2?**

Since the timelines for Jetstream2 are still uncertain at this time, we would recommend that your research group get a startup allocation now on Jetstream1 and get a supplement for JS2 when it becomes available. As we recommend the API side for gateways and infrastructure, migrating to JS2 will be reasonably easy.
