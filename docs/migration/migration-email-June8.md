Greetings,

You have been identified by XSEDE as a current PI, researcher, or student on the Jetstream Cloud resource. The Jetstream Cloud will be retiring soon. The Jetstream2 Cloud is currently in early operations and ready for all research and education activities. This list has been created to notify all current users of the system about the need to move to Jetstream2, the timelines, how to go about it, and any other information of value.

If you have already moved your usage over to Jetstream2, we would ask that you delete any servers or volumes you no longer need on Jetstream1. You may also disregard the rest of this message and/or remove yourself from this mailing list.

You can unsubscribe by emailing js1-migration-l-unsubscribe@list.iu.edu

Jetstream1 (JS1)  will remain online through the end of July 2022. We are no longer accepting any new allocations on Jetstream1 as Jetstream2 (JS2) has entered operations phase. There will be no extension beyond July 31 for JS1. All allocations will be disabled and denied access at that time.

We strongly recommend users migrate to JS2 as soon as possible. VMs on JS1 will continue running as long as you have a valid allocation there but only until it is decommissioned. The TACC cloud of JS1 will likely be taken down in stages prior to the IU cloud.

Information on the migration to JS2 may be found here:

https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/migration/migration_overview/

and general How-To instructions may be found here:

https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/migration/how_to_migrate/

*** Please note that NO JS1 RESOURCES WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO JS2 BY DEFAULT. ***

All data will require your human interaction if you wish to save it. ***

Weâ€™ll also be automatically adding JS2 supplements in the next 10-14 days for active JS1 allocations to help with migration. We highly recommend being proactive, though, and requesting a JS2 supplement sooner if you are a PI or resource manager on an existing JS allocation.

Instructions for that are here:

https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/alloc/supplement/

Please do feel free to contact us via our contact form at https://jetstream-cloud.org/contact/index.html for any questions not covered in the JS2 migration or general documentation.

Thank you,
The Jetstream/Jetstream2 Staff
