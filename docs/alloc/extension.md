# Jetstream2 Allocation Extension

If your allocation is expired or close to expired and has adequate SUs remaining for the resource(s), you may request a supplement.

Detailed information about the extension request process is available from the [XSEDE Manage Allocations](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/managing#managealloc-extensions){target=_blank} page.

*Please note: Extensions are not a substitution for the renewal process.*

If you have a startup allocation and you are planning to stay under the startup limits (as noted on the [Jetstream Resources](../general/resources.md) page), you may continue to renew your startup and not have to enter the research allocations cycle. A renewal is **ALWAYS** preferred over an extension.

Research allocations may be extended **once** with *adequate justification*.
