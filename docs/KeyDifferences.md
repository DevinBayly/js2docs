# Key Differences Between Jetstream1 and Jetstream2
---

Jetstream1 utilized two primary clouds, geographically dispersed and powered by [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/){target=_blank}, to provide thousands of concurrent virtual machines to researchers, educators, and students from hundreds of institutions across the United States. Jetstream1 featured Atmosphere, a user-friendly graphical user environment, as the means of access for the majority of users. Jetstream1 also allowed API access for infrastructure-driven projects like science gateways.

There will be quite a few similarities between Jetstream1 and Jetstream2. Jetstream2 will be powered by a more recent version of OpenStack and will still have a primary mission of providing virtual machine services to research and education faculty, staff, and students. Jetstream2, however, will build on what Jetstream1 delivered and provide a number of improvements and new services. This page will try to identify the major differences.

The biggest difference is that Jetstream2 will consist of one primary cloud and multiple regional clouds. As you can see by the image below, the primary cloud will be hosted at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN with regional clouds at various institutions across the United States.

Allocations will only be awarded on the primary cloud by default.
